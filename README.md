Gesture Recognition using Matlab
Gesture Recognition using Matlab is a program that can detect hand gestures and recognize them based on a pre-defined set of gestures. 
This program can be useful for developing interactive applications that respond to hand gestures or for building more complex gesture recognition systems.
Usage
To run the Gesture Recognition program, navigate to the directory where the program is saved and open the Matlab script gesture_recognition.m. You can then run the script by clicking the "Run" button in the Matlab interface.

When the program is running, it will capture video input from a webcam and display the video feed on the screen. You can then perform hand gestures in front of the webcam and the program will attempt to recognize the gesture.

The program includes a pre-defined set of gestures that it can recognize, including gestures for moving left, right, up, down, and for performing a click. You can modify the set of gestures by modifying the code in the gesture_recognition.m script.

Customization
If you want to customize the behavior of the Gesture Recognition program, you can modify the source code in the gesture_recognition.m script. For example, you can modify the set of gestures that the program can recognize or modify the image processing algorithms used to detect and track the user's hand.

Error Handling
The Gesture Recognition program includes error handling to handle potential issues that may arise during execution. If an error occurs, the program will display an error message in the Matlab console.

Conclusion
The Gesture Recognition program provides a simple implementation of a gesture recognition system using Matlab. This program can be used as a starting point for more complex gesture recognition applications or for developing interactive applications that respond to hand gestures.
